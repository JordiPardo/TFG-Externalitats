# Mitigating Urban Externalities: A Comparative Study of Madrid and Barcelona

## Context
Undergraduate thesis in Economics (Universitat Rovira i Virgili, 2025).  
The project explores how large urban areas manage negative externalities such as air pollution, traffic congestion, accidents, and noise, with a focus on the cases of Madrid and Barcelona.

## Objective
To assess whether public policies (e.g. Madrid Central, Barcelona’s Low-Emission Zone and Superblocks) effectively mitigated externalities and improved urban sustainability.

## Data
- Air quality: NO₂ concentration levels (2015–2023)  
- Traffic data: TomTom Traffic Index and city indicators  
- Accidents: Municipal accident records  
- Policy dummies: ZBE implementation, COVID period, etc.  

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and integration with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Econometric modelling using OLS regressions with HAC/Newey-West errors  
- Comparative analysis between Madrid and Barcelona to detect similarities and divergences in policy impact  

## Key Results
- Air quality: partial improvements after Madrid Central and ZBE, though results vary by area  
- Traffic: evidence of displacement (congestion reduction in restricted areas, but increases in periphery)  
- Accidents: mixed results, no clear trend reduction after policies  

## Repository Structure
- `/code` → Python scripts
- `/data` → (not included here; available via official municipal portals)  
- `/figures` → key plots and visuals  

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)    
- Excel (Data preparation, summaries)
